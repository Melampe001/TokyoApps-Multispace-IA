## 🏆 Severity Levels

We categorize vulnerabilities using the following severity levels:

### Critical

**Impact:** Complete system compromise, data breach, or RCE

**Examples:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- SQL Injection leading to full database access
- Authentication bypass
- Mass data exposure

**Response Time:** Patch within 24-48 hours

### High

**Impact:** Significant security risk affecting many users

**Examples:**
- Privilege escalation
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) with session hijacking
- Insecure direct object references
- Sensitive data exposure

**Response Time:** Patch within 7 days

### Medium

**Impact:** Moderate security risk with limited impact

**Examples:**

- CSRF without significant impact
- Missing security controls
- Weak cryptography

**Response Time:** Patch within 30 days

### Low

**Impact:** Minor security risk with minimal impact

**Examples:**
- Security misconfiguration
